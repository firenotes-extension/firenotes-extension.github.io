    <h3>What is FireNotes?</h3>
    <p>FireNotes is a notepad application that you can open anytime, anywhere. No matter where you are on the web, you can always consult and edit your notepad. Plus, you can use useful features like dark mode or the burn button. Whoever you are, FireNotes will be a great help to you!</p>
    <h3>How and where can I install FireNotes?</h3>
    <p>FireNotes is currently available for Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera (And Opera GX) and Mozilla Firefox. If you don't have one of these browsers, you can always use the web version. Visit the download page below to download FireNotes to your browser.</p>
    <button onclick="window.location.href='https://firenotes-extension.github.io/download/'">Download Now</button>
    <button onclick="window.location.href='https://firenotes-extension.github.io/web-version/'">Web Version</button>
    <h3>Is FireNotes available for other browsers?</h3>
    <p>FireNotes can also be installed on other browsers, such as Vivaldi, Brave, and other Chromium-based browsers. You just have to go to the Chrome Web Store and download it conventionally.</p>
    <h3>Is FireNotes compatible with Safari?</h3>
    <p>No, FireNotes is not compatible with Safari, but you can install another macOS compatible browser to use FireNotes. You can also use the web version with Safari.</p>
    <h3>How do I open FireNotes?</h3>
    <p>Once the extension is installed, click the extension button on the taskbar (üß©), and the menu with all your extensions will open, including FireNotes. Click on FireNotes, and the pop-up with the program will open, and the text you were working on last time will automatically load. If you prefer, you can open it as an external window with the window icon, located in the toolbar of FireNotes. To close the pop-up, simply click outside of it or press the "Esc" key.</p>
    <p><em>Tip: If you want the button to launch FireNotes to be on the taskbar, go to the extensions menu and click the pin icon (The eye icon if you use edge). If you use Firefox: Go to the extensions menu and right-click on FireNotes, then activate "Pin to taskbar."</em></p>
    <p><em><strong>Opera and Opera GX users:</strong> The FireNotes icon is located in the sidebar. To open it, click, and it will open in the side panel.</em></p>
    <h3>Open FireNotes in the side panel/sidebar</h3>
    <p>You can open FireNotes in the sidebar and keep it open, so you can edit and read while visiting your web pages. The process to open FireNotes in this mode varies depending on the browser you use:</p>
    <p><strong>Chrome:</strong> Press the side panel icon, located in the upper right. Once pressed, the side panel will open. To display FireNotes in the side panel, open the side panel dropdown and select FireNotes.</p>
    <p><strong>Edge:</strong> Open the extension's menu, find the FireNotes extension, and tap the icon to open it in the sidebar, located next to the extension title. You can also right-click on the extension and select the option to open it in the sidebar.</p>
    <p><strong>Opera:</strong> In Opera by default it opens in the side panel when you open it normally. You don't have to do anything else.</p>
    <p><strong>Firefox:</strong> The quickest way to open the sidebar in Firefox is by using the key combination "Ctrl + Alt + N" ("Command + Option + N" if you use Mac). You can use this same combination to close the extension at any time.</p>
    <h3>How do I uninstall FireNotes?</h3>
    <p>Go to the extensions menu and click the option menu, then select "Remove extension."</p>
    <p><em>Tip: If you want to delete all data and reset the program to the default state, you don't need to uninstall the extension. You can use the "Reset" button in the FireNotes settings (‚öôÔ∏è). If you want to temporarily stop using the extension without losing data, you can deactivate the extension.</em></p>

    <h2 id="usage">Usage and Features</h2>
    <h3>How to start writing</h3>
    <p>To start writing in your blank notepad, just click on the empty area. Once you've done that, you can write whatever you want in the notepad.</p>
    <h3>How to save my text</h3>
    <p>FireNotes automatically saves everything you write, without pressing save buttons. Whenever you start the program, it will automatically load the last text you were working on. If you want to start over, you can delete everything manually using the "Reset" button in the settings (‚öôÔ∏è) or using the burn text button (üî•). We'll talk more about this last option later.</p>
    <h3>Increase or decrease text size</h3>
    <p>You can always increase or decrease the text size using the magnifying glass buttons (üîé). Use + to increase and - to decrease. When you start the program, the text size will automatically adjust to what you had last time. If you want to return to the default size, use the "Reset" button in the settings (‚öôÔ∏è), although keep in mind that other data will be lost.</p>
    <h3>Burn text</h3>
    <p>If you click the "üî•" burn text button, all your text will be deleted, but don't worry, it's still safe because the text you were editing has been copied to the clipboard. This means you can paste the text wherever you want in the browser or the system using Control + V (Command + V on macOS) or right-click and select "Paste." If you pressed it by accident, don't worry, you can paste the text back into the notepad and continue working.</p>
    <h3>Choose a font</h3>
    <p>In the header, you'll see a dropdown next to the icons. There you can choose the font you want to use in your documents. For now, you can choose from these fonts: Arial, Georgia, Monospace, and Italic. The program will always remember the font you used last time.</p>
    <h3>ChatGPT</h3>
    <p>Clicking on the ChatGPT icon will open an external window with the ChatGPT website. This might be useful if you want to ask questions as you write. You can also use the FireNotes notebook to paste AI-generated responses for more convenient editing and viewing.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="settings">Settings and Customization</h2>
    <h3>How to open the Settings menu</h3>
    <p>To open the Settings menu, simply click the gear button (‚öôÔ∏è), which is located in the upper right corner of the editor. All the features we'll go over in this section are inside this menu.</p>
    <h3>Reset</h3>
    <p>This function will delete all the application's data and return it to the default state. When you click the button, it will ask if you really want to reset everything. If you accept, the text you were working on will be deleted without the possibility of recovery, so it's advisable to move that text to another place before resetting. It will also deactivate dark mode, reset text size and font to the default state, and choose the default language of the browser.</p>
    <h3>Dark Mode</h3>
    <p>If you plan to work for a long time, are in a dark environment, or just want to give your notepad a special touch, you can activate dark mode. When activated, the entire program will have dark colors.</p>
    <h3>UI Sounds</h3>
    <p>The FireNotes extension plays small sound effects when performing certain actions, such as burning text, activating or deactivating options, or to alert you of warnings and errors. If you want to disable them, you can uncheck the "Sounds" box in the settings menu.</p>
    <h3>Interface Language</h3>
    <p>You can change the interface language at any time. When you first load the program, it will choose the default language of the browser. If it's not available, English will be chosen.</p>
    <h3>Credits and Links</h3>
    <p>Here you will find various menus with information about the program and external links.</p>
    <p><strong>About:</strong> Here you can check the program credits, see the current version, and view resources from other users used in FireNotes.</p>
