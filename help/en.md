## Introduction and Installation

### What is FireNotes?
FireNotes is a notepad application that you can open anytime, anywhere. No matter where you are on the web, you can always consult and edit your notepad. Plus, you can use useful features like dark mode or the burn button. Whoever you are, FireNotes will be a great help to you!

### How and where can I install FireNotes?
FireNotes is available for download on Mozilla Firefox from the Firefox Add-ons store, completely free of charge. If you don't have Firefox or simply don't want to install it, you can use it without prior installation from our website and use the web version of the program.

### Is FireNotes available for other browsers?
Currently, FireNotes is only available for desktop Firefox browsers. We plan to release our extension on Chromium-based browsers in the near future, such as Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Brave, Vivaldi, etc. If you don't have a Firefox browser, you can always use the web version, which is compatible with all browsers and devices.

### How do I open FireNotes in Firefox?
Once the extension is installed, click the extension button on the taskbar (üß©), and the menu with all your extensions will open, including FireNotes. Click on FireNotes, and the pop-up with the program will open, and the text you were working on last time will automatically load. If you prefer, you can open it as an external window with the "Open in external window" button. To close the pop-up, simply click outside of it or press the "Esc" key.

*Tip: If you want the button to launch FireNotes to be on the taskbar, go to the extensions menu and right-click on FireNotes, then activate "Pin to taskbar."*

### How do I uninstall FireNotes?
Go to the extensions menu and right-click on FireNotes, then select "Remove extension."

*Tip: If you want to delete all data and reset the program to the default state, you don't need to uninstall the extension. You can use the "Reset" button in the FireNotes settings (‚öôÔ∏è). If you want to temporarily stop using the extension without losing data, you can deactivate the extension.*

## Usage and Features

### How to start writing
To start writing in your blank notepad, just click on the empty area. Once you've done that, you can write whatever you want in the notepad.

### How to save my text
FireNotes automatically saves everything you write, without pressing save buttons. Whenever you start the program, it will automatically load the last text you were working on. If you want to start over, you can delete everything manually using the "Reset" button in the settings (‚öôÔ∏è) or using the burn text button (üî•). We'll talk more about this last option later.

### Increase or decrease text size
You can always increase or decrease the text size using the magnifying glass buttons (üîé). Use + to increase and - to decrease. When you start the program, the text size will automatically adjust to what you had last time. If you want to return to the default size, use the "Reset" button in the settings (‚öôÔ∏è), although keep in mind that other data will be lost.

### Burn text
If you click the "üî•" burn text button, all your text will be deleted, but don't worry, it's still safe because the text you were editing has been copied to the clipboard. This means you can paste the text wherever you want in the browser or the system using Control + V (Command + V on macOS) or right-click and select "Paste." If you pressed it by accident, don't worry, you can paste the text back into the notepad and continue working.

### Choose a font
In the header, you'll see a dropdown next to the icons. There you can choose the font you want to use in your documents. For now, you can choose from these fonts: Arial, Georgia, Monospace, and Italic. The program will always remember the font you used last time. More fonts will be added in the future.

## Settings and Customization

### How to open the Settings menu
To open the Settings menu, simply click the gear button (‚öôÔ∏è), which is located in the upper right corner of the editor. All the features we'll go over in this section are inside this menu.

### Reset
This function will delete all the application's data and return it to the default state. When you click the button, it will ask if you really want to reset everything. If you accept, the text you were working on will be deleted without the possibility of recovery, so it's advisable to move that text to another place before resetting. It will also deactivate dark mode, reset text size and font to the default state, and choose the default language of the browser.

### Dark Mode
If you plan to work for a long time, are in a dark environment, or just want to give your notepad a special touch, you can activate dark mode. When activated, the entire program will have dark colors.

### Interface Language
You can change the interface language at any time. When you first load the program, it will choose the default language of the browser. If it's not available, English will be chosen.
